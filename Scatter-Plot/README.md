# Scatter Plot 
A simple scatter plot displaying GDP vs. Energy Consumption per Capita, 2010 <br>

Data is pulled from scatterdata.csv <br>
Along the x-axis is GDP in Trillions of US Dollars and along the y-axis is EPC (Energy Consumption per Capita) in Million BTUs per person. Each circle represents a country with area proportional to total energy consumption in Trillion BTUs, obtained by multiplying EPC with population. All data is for the year 2010.<br>

Mouse over the circles to see the country name, population, GDP, EPC and total energy consumption. You can also pan and zoom through the scatter plot.
